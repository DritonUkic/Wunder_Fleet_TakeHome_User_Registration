## Design Document 
  ### Goals:
- [x] Small app using JS, Git, SCSS and optionally any third party library or framework.
- [x] Basic user registration with 4 separated steps and only one active step at a time.
- [x] The steps will be personal, address, payment and success.
- [x] Locally saved data
- [x] The payment step will execute a POST request to the backend when the "next" button gets clicked.
  
- [x] The user will be able to leave the registration on every step/view and to reload his progress.
- [x] No access control or validation
- [ ] Custom SCSS style accordingly to the corporate identity.
- [ ] Minimal UI
- [ ] Structure of the code using MVC/MVI/MVVM or any other pattern with explanation

### Preperation 
  #### Technologies
  ##### Only JavaScript with Bootstrap
  * Pros:
    * Fast loading time
    * No overhead
    * Quickly done
    * Less files
    * Wunder uses Bootstrap
  * Cons:
    * Harder to maintain/scale
    * Therefore not well suited for large teams
      
  ##### Angular with Material, Rxjs and NgRx using Redux pattern
   * Pros:
      * Scalable and easy to maintain
      * Well suited for large teams
   * Cons:
      * Takes longer to build
      * Unnecessary overhead for this small app
      * Many files
 ### Decision     
   I've decided to go with the second approach because working in a large team was a topic in the interview and I think it will draw more attention to the application.  
   In the context of a small application only consisting of a register form with local storage and one POST request with no further development it would be smarter to write the app in "vanilla" JavaScript.  
   I will compile the Angular application so there wonÂ´t be the requirement of having node installed.

            * setIban
            * setCustomerId
            * setPaymentDataId
            * Default
            
  #### Classes/ Interfaces
  ```typescript
  
    export interface Personal {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
        telephone: string;
    };
  
    export interface Address {
        street: string;
        houseNumber: string;
        zipCode: string;
        city: string;
    };
    
    
    export interface Payment {
        accountOwner: string;
        iban: string;
        customerId: number;
        paymentDataId: string;
    };
    
    
    class customerData{
      personalData: Personal;
      addressData: Address;
      paymentData: Payment;
      lastRegisterStep: number;
    }
  

  ```
  #### LocalStorage Functions
        CheckLS -> Check if a storedUser exists and then manipulate states
        Update[*Interfaces]LS -> Update storedUser with new states
        getStep -> Get storedUser.lastRegisterStep
        updateStepLS -> Update lastStep in localstorage
